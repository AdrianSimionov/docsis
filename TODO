- move the symbol table into an XML configuration file. This would make it 
  very easy to add new symbols without recompiling. It would also enable 
  people to distribute Vendor Specific-enabled configuration files  
- autoconf & automake -- DONE
- test framework (i.e. a bunch of reference config files etc)  -- DONE
- use getopt() to get command line arguments. Probably will need to change args 
  and thus break compatibility ... -- ON HOLD (keep it simple, stupid). 
- rewrite everything using an XML file format (really?!)
- Make loading of SNMP modules configurable (using "-m" switch instead of loading 
  everything under the sun)

1. System Requirements

You need the following packages to compile this program:

	* OpenSSL 0.9.6 or newer
	* net-snmp version 5.0.7pre2 (later releases should work, see notes) 
	* flex 2.5.4 or newer
	* bison 1.25 or newer

Get OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org if you don't have it already. Most 
Linux distributions come with OpenSSL pre-installed (e.g. -lcrypt)

Get NET-SNMP from http://www.net-snmp.org.

I used net-snmp-5.0.7pre2 myself. Support for UCD-SNMP has been dropped as of 
version 0.8.1 of docsis. 

You can use "./configure --prefix=/usr" when building NET-SNMP. If you use the 
default "./configure", please edit the Makefile and adjust CFLAGS and LIBS 
accordingly (by default, NET-SNMP installs in /usr/local/, so you will need 
to uncomment the "LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib" line in the Makefile).

Many Linux distributions come with UCD-SNMP preinstalled (as of February 2003). 
This may create some confusion when you install net-snmp and maybe break some programs 
like Ethereal. The best solution is to remove the ucd-snmp library you got with your 
distribution, install net-snmp, and recompile the programs that depend on ucd-snmp against 
net-snmp. 

You also need flex & bison. I tested with flex 2.5.4 and bison 1.25 on SuSE Linux 
8.0 and Solaris 2.6.

Lex and Yacc don't work. It's probably easy to make the code work with them but
I don't care; if you make it work send us a patch.

To get flex & bison go to ftp://ftp.gnu.org. All GNU/Linux 
distributions have them, so you probably don't have to worry about. Try:

$ flex --version
$ bison --version 

2. Installation instructions 

When you have all of the above, do 

unix $ gzip -cd docsis-x.y.z-RELEASE.tgz | tar xvf -
unix $ cd docsis-x.y.z-RELEASE
# edit Makefile; adjust CFLAGS and LIBS for your net-snmp installation 
unix $ make  				# if you're on Linux, or 
unix $ make -f Makefile.solaris 	# if you're on Solaris

If everything works fine, you now have an executable called "docsis". Try 

unix $ ./docsis 

If you get an error about loading the SNMP shared libraries, you need to 

unix $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<location_of_netsnmp_library>
unix $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

For example if NET-SNMP is installed in /opt/net-snmp, you would do:

unix $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/net-snmp/lib
unix $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If you have problems send an e-mail to docsis-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  
Please include:

	- a description of your platform (operating system, compiler, etc) 
	- the debug output of the program
	- the files you are trying to encode/decode 
	- any other information you deem relevant

3. Notes

If your DEFS (in Makefile) include -DDEBUG you will build some debug code 
which is kinda useful when you're left staring at the stars because it doesn't 
work.

If you want to debug the program (using gdb for example), add "-g" to CFLAGS (in Makefile). 

If you leave "-g -DDEBUG" for your final ("production") executable you will suffer 
a little performance penalty.

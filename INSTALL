You must have UCD-SNMP installed on your system before compiling this software.
You can get UCD-SNMP from http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu.

You can use "./configure --prefix=/usr" when building UCD-SNMP. If you use the 
default "./configure", please edit Makefile and adjust CFLAGS and LIBS 
accordingly (by default, UCD-SNMP installs in /usr/local/).

I used ucd-snmp-4.1.2 myself. It could work with an earlier version however
this has not been tested so I do not recommend it. 

You need flex & bison. I tested with flex 2.5.4 and bison 1.25 on SuSE Linux 
6.4.
Lex & Yacc should work fine, although they were not tested. You have to edit 
"Makefile" to replace flex with lex and bison with yacc.

When you have all of the above, do 

unix $ gzip -cd docsis-x.y.z-RELEASE.tgz | tar xvf -
unix $ cd docsis-x.y.z-RELEASE
unix $ make 

If everything works fine, now you have an executable called "docsis". 

If you have problems you can send an E-mail to ctrl@users.sourceforge.net. I will 
do my best to give you a quick answer but I may be too busy sometimes. 

If your DEFS (in Makefile) include -DDEBUG you will build some debug code 
which is kinda useful when you're left staring at the stars because it doesn't 
work. 

If you want to debug the program (using gdb for example), add "-g" to CFLAGS (in Makefile).

1. System Requirements

You need the following packages to compile this program:

	* OpenSSL 0.9.6 or later
	* ucd-snmp version 4.2 (later releases should work, see notes) 
	* flex 2.5.4
	* bison 1.25

Get OpenSSL from http://www.openssl.org if you don't have it already. Most 
Linux distributions come with OpenSSL pre-installed.

Get UCD-SNMP (which has just been renamed NET-SNMP) from 
http://www.net-snmp.org.

You can use "./configure --prefix=/usr" when building UCD-SNMP. If you use the 
default "./configure", please edit Makefile and adjust CFLAGS and LIBS 
accordingly (by default, UCD-SNMP installs in /usr/local/, so you will need 
to uncomment the "LIBS=-L/usr/local/lib" line in the Makefile).

I used ucd-snmp-4.1.2 and ucd-snmp-4.2 myself.  Earlier releases won't work, 
later releases may work. 

You need flex & bison. I tested with flex 2.5.4 and bison 1.25 on SuSE Linux 
6.4 and Solaris 2.6.

Lex and Yacc don't work. It's probably easy to make the code work with them but
I don't care, if you make it work send me a patch.

To get flex & bison go to ftp://ftp.gnu.org. All GNU/Linux 
distributions have them, so you probably don't have to worry about. Try:

$ flex --version
$ bison --version 


2. Installation instructions 

When you have all of the above, do 

unix $ gzip -cd docsis-x.y.z-RELEASE.tgz | tar xvf -
unix $ cd docsis-x.y.z-RELEASE
unix $ make  				# if you're on Linux, or 
unix $ make -f Makefile.solaris 	# if you're on Solaris

If everything works fine, now you have an executable called "docsis". 

If you have problems can send an E-mail to docsis-users@lists.sourceforge.net. 

3. Notes

If your DEFS (in Makefile) include -DDEBUG you will build some debug code 
which is kinda useful when you're left staring at the stars because it doesn't 
work. 

If you have ucd-snmp-4.2 or later, you need to add "-lcrypto" to the LIBS 
variable in Makefile.

If you want to debug the program (using gdb for example), add "-g" to CFLAGS (in Makefile).

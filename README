2. Description

This program encodes text configuration files which contain Configuration File 
Settings (as per the DOCSIS RFI 1.0 Specification) into binary configuration 
files, as specified by the DOCSIS RFI 1.0 Specification, Appendix C.

It supports most DOCSIS 1.0 Configuration Settings. Not supported (currently):

	* Telephony Settings
	* Modem Capabilities
	* Vendor-specific information
	* Vendor ID
	* TFTP server timestamp
	* TFTP server provisioned modem address

See DOCSIS 1.0 Radio Frequency Interface Specification, Appendix C for a 
description of these settings.


A limited range of ASN types are supported for SNMP MibObjects (the most used
types). Adding a new ASN type is as easy as cut&paste from UCD-SNMP source code into docsis_snmp.c, function encode_vbind (well, maybe a few changes are needed,
but I trust the reader can figure it out).

More than one (up to 16) ClassOfService statements can appear. Only one 
BaselinePrivacy (BPI) statement can appear. The program does not check for the 
number of ClassOfService statements that appear, you have to make sure not 
to include more than 16 or unexpected results will occur. 

DOCSIS BPI Specification clearly states that the BPI settings MUST NOT be 
present if Privacy is not enabled in [at least one of] the ClassOfService 
parameters (for example if PrivacyEnable is 0 for all classes of service, BPI
statement should not appear). 

The program is not yet as "intelligent" as to detect these problems 
automatically (quite trivial).

3. Usage

To encode a configuration file, do:

unix $ ./docsis my_config_file.cfg my_key_file my_config_file.md5

The format of the text configuration file, although simple, is not described 
anywhere but the source code (see the grammar in docsis_yy.y and lexical 
analyzer in docsis_lex.l). As sometimes an example is more useful than a 
truckload of documentation, I've included a few configuration files (see 
examples/*.cfg).

An example key is provided in file testkey.key. The key is only a string of 
characters. Any trailing newline (\n) or carriage return (\r) characters are 
chopped.

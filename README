2. Description
==============

This program encodes text configuration files which contain Configuration File 
Settings into binary configuration files, as specified by the DOCSIS RFI 1.1
Specification, Appendix C.

It supports most DOCSIS 1.1 Configuration Settings. Not supported (currently):

	* Telephony Settings
	* Modem Capabilities
	* Vendor-specific information
	* Vendor ID
	* TFTP server timestamp
	* TFTP server provisioned modem address
	* SNMPv3 settings

See DOCSIS 1.1 Radio Frequency Interface Specification, Appendix C for a 
description of these settings.

A limited range of ASN types are supported for SNMP MibObjects (the most used
types - Integer, String, HexString, IP Address). Adding a new ASN type is as 
easy as cut&paste from UCD-SNMP source code into docsis_snmp.c, function 
encode_vbind (well, maybe a few changes are needed, but I trust the reader can 
figure it out).

A. DOCSIS 1.0 considerations 
============================

More than one (up to 16) ClassOfService statements can appear in the 
configuration file. Only one BaselinePrivacy (BPI) statement can appear. 
The program does not check for the number of ClassOfService statements that 
appear, you have to make sure not to include more than 16 or unexpected results will occur  (modems / CMTSes may reset).

DOCSIS BPI Specification clearly states that the BPI settings MUST NOT be 
present if Privacy is not enabled in [at least one of] the ClassOfService 
parameters (for example if PrivacyEnable is 0 for all classes of service, BPI
statement should not appear). 

The program is not yet as "intelligent" as to detect these problems 
automatically (quite trivial).

B. DOCSIS 1.1 considerations
============================

The DOCSIS 1.1 implementation is being tested. A major rewrite was needed to 
add support for DOCSIS 1.1 and clean up the parsing, encoding and decoding, so
expect the docsis-0.7.x versions to be be less stable/bug-free than the 
docsis-0.6.x series. However because of the cleanup (mostly done by the Evvolve
guys) the bugs will be much easier to fix and the new features (configuration
settings) A LOT easier to add. 

3. Usage
========

To encode a configuration file, do:

unix $ ./docsis -e my_config_file.cfg my_key_file my_config_file.md5

The format of the text configuration file, although simple, is not described 
anywhere but the source code (see the grammar in docsis_yy.y and lexical 
analyzer in docsis_lex.l). As sometimes an example is more useful than a 
truckload of documentation, I've included a few configuration files (see 
examples/*.cfg).

An example key is provided in file testkey.key. The key is only a string of 
characters. Any trailing newline (\n) or carriage return (\r) characters are 
chopped. 

To decode a binary file, do:

unix $ ./docsis -d my_binary_file.md5

The decoded output is not always "compatible" with itself, eg cannot be 
directly encoded back into a binary file. 

This is mostly due to the usage of ucd-snmp library functions to print the 
SnmpMibObjects, which print out a different syntax than what we need.

If you want to encode back a decoded file, you have to fix the syntax of 
SnmpMibObject settings and delete CM MIC and CMTS MIC lines. 
Then you should be able to encode the file back.

4. Adding new configuration settings
====================================

To add new configuration settings, in most cases the only thing you need to 
do is add them to the docsis_symtable.h (make sure you select the correct 
type-functions for encoding and decoding). 

Because of the way the encoder works, the {symbol_name, docsis_code} pair 
must be unique, e.g. if two symbols share the same name they MUST share the 
same docsis_code, type-functions, limits etc. Only the id and parent can be 
different.
